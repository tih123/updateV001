                </li>

            <h2>Server Side Includes</h2>
            <p>Several common components (such as page headers, footers, navigation, etc.) are included in pages using Server Side Includes (SSI). Note that the web server that hosts the State Template should be configured to process SSI's with the .html extension.</p>
            <h2>Icon Fonts</h2>
            <p><a href="/sample/icon-fonts.html">Icon Fonts</a> are also included as part of the State Template. These icon fonts were developed by OTECH, with some additions from other sources.</p>

            <h2>Mime Type Configurations</h2>
            <p>Newer versions of IIS (such as 8.5) already have mime types defined for fonts. However, older versions may need to be configured to serve those mime types for fonts. The same may apply for other web servers such as Apache HTTP Server. Below is a list of the mime types that must be defined for the 2014 State Template.</p>
            <ul class="list-standout">
                <li>.eot - application/vnd.ms-fontobject</li>
                <li>.ttf - application/octet-stream</li>
                <li>.svg - image/svg+xml</li>
                <li>.woff - application/x-woff</li>
